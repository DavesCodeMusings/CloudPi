  # The high-level process for creating a self-hosted certificate authority is:
  # 1. Create a strong private key.
  # 2. Create a signing request using the private key.
  # 3. Self-sign the request to create the certificate authority (CA) root.
  # 4. Create an intermediate certificate signed by the CA root.
  # 5. Use the intermediate certificate to sign everything else.
