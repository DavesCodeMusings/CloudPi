**_Turn a raspberry pi into a modern cloud computing solution for your home._**

Sure, that sounds cool, but what does it actually mean?

With a single Raspberry Pi 4, you can:
* Replicate personal files between your various devices using Nextcloud storage.
* Create a media library and make it availble to your home entertainment system through CIFS share.
* Monitor your home with Home Assistant and create complex integrations with Node-Red, and Mosquitto.
* Create your own DNS infrastructure and refer to your devices by name instead of IP addresses.
* Secure your services and network traffic with SSL certificates and keep The Man out of your business.
* Centralize your account and passwords for any applications that support LDAP.
* Stash all your nerdy code repositories locally using Gitea.

Spend your time using the system, not maintaining it.
* Deploy applications quickly using Docker containers.
* Automate mundane system configuration tasks with Ansible.

Does this sound like your kind of thing? Get yourself a 4Gig Raspberry Pi 4 and let's go!

# Coming Soon
New and improved documentation tailored for Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye

Planned enhancements:
* Switching container deployment from Ansible's Community Docker to Portainer Stacks.
* Documentation in GitHub Pages rather than wiki.
* Redeploy wiki as specific tasks supplemental to documentation.

In the meantime, the original documentation for Raspberry Pi OS Buster is here: [https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/CloudPi/wiki](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/CloudPi/wiki)
