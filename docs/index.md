**_Turn a Raspberry Pi into a modern cloud computing solution for your home._**

Sure, that sounds cool, but what does it actually mean?

With a single Raspberry Pi 4, you can:
* Replicate personal files between your various devices using Nextcloud storage.
* Create a media library and make it availble to your home entertainment system through Samba shares.
* Monitor your home with Home Assistant and create custom integrations with Node-Red, and Mosquitto.
* Create your own DNS infrastructure and refer to your devices by name instead of IP addresses.
* Secure your services and network traffic with SSL certificates and keep The Man out of your business.
* Centralize your account and passwords for any applications that support OpenLDAP.
* Stash all your nerdy code repositories locally using a Gitea git server.

Spend your time using the system, not maintaining it.
* Docker containers let you deploy applications quickly.
* Ansible lets you automate the mundane tasks of installation and system configuration.

Does this sound like your kind of thing? Get yourself a 4Gig Raspberry Pi 4 and let's go!

# Coming Soon
New and improved documentation tailored for Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye

Planned enhancements:
* Switching container deployment from Ansible's Community Docker to Portainer Stacks.
* Documentation in GitHub Pages rather than wiki.
* Redeploy wiki as specific tasks supplemental to documentation.

The beginnings of the [new project documents can be previewed](motivation.md)

In the meantime, the original documentation for Raspberry Pi OS Buster is here: [https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/CloudPi/wiki](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/CloudPi/wiki)
