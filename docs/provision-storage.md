# Summary
In this step, you'll prepare the external hard drive.

# Can I skip it?
You can run your entire system off of the micro-SD card if you want. There's not a lot of capacity, but if your needs are light, it will work. Where you will run into problems is with the constant writing of data, logs, and everything else to an inexpensive device that was never really designed for the task. Eventually, the SD card will get corrupted. When this happens, you'll no longer be able to access your operating system or the data it holds.

With an external storage device, particularly something like a Western Digital Red or Seagate IronWolf (either spinning disk or SSD), you're relying on something designed for 24/7 operation rather than a device intended to store MP3s and pictures for your phone. Do not be tempted by that USB "backup drive" or flash drive in the weekly sale advertising circular, either. These devices are designed for intermittent use and will eventually fail if pressed into constant duty.

With separate OS and data devices, you also have the possibility of recovering your data without restoring from backup. If the SD card becomes unusable, there's a good chance you can flash a new one and mount your external drive to get your data back.

>Of course, none of this helps in extreme situations like fire, flood, a plague locusts, etc. Be sure to keep [backup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup) copies for the important files for this reason.
