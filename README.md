# CloudPi
Oh, you run a web server on your Raspberry Pi? That's so cute. This one runs...
* [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
* [Samba](https://www.samba.org/)
* [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
* [NodeRED](https://nodered.org/)
* [Mosquitto MQTT](https://mosquitto.org/)
* [Gitea](https://gitea.com/)
* [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)
* [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/)
* [BIND9 DNS](https://www.isc.org/bind/)
* [OpenSSL Certificate Authority (CA)](https://www.openssl.org/)

Oh yeah, and there's an [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) web server too.

The CloudPi project is in a state of flux at the moment. With the release of Raspberry Pi OS 11 (Bullseye) everything is getting reworked. The new version is here:

[https://davescodemusings.github.io/CloudPi/](https://davescodemusings.github.io/CloudPi/)

There may be some rough edges, but it's mostly complete and alpha tested.

If you don't have the latest and greatest OS, [the wiki](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/CloudPi/wiki) still has the previous version using Pi OS 10 (Buster).
