# CloudPi
Oh, you run a web server on your Raspberry Pi? That's so cute. This one runs...
* Nextcloud
* Samba
* Home Assistant
* NodeRED
* Mosquitto MQTT
* Gitea
* Portainer
* OpenLDAP
* BIND9 DNS
* TLS Certificate Authority (CA)

Oh yeah, and there's an Nginx web server too.

The CloudPi project is in a state of flux at the moment. With the release of Raspberry Pi OS 11 (Bullseye) everything is getting reworked. The new version is here:

[https://davescodemusings.github.io/CloudPi/](https://davescodemusings.github.io/CloudPi/)

There may be some rough edges, but it's mostly complete and alpha tested.

If you don't have the latest and greatest OS, [the wiki](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/CloudPi/wiki) still has the previous version using Pi OS 10 (Buster).
