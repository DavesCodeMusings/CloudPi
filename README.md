# CloudPi
Cloudy with a chance of raspberries.

Shell scripts and Ansible playbooks to take Raspberry Pi OS Lite to an on-premise cloud with a minimum of fuss.

In the end, the Pi will:

* Host DNS and DHCP.
* Provide a Docker Community Edition container environment.
* Offer Portainer management of Docker.
* Run NextCloud as an on-premise file sharing and collaboration application.
