# CloudPi
Turn a Raspberry Pi 4 into an on-premise cloud with a minimum of fuss.

What you get:

* NextCloud as an on-premise file sharing and collaboration application.
* Docker Community Edition container environment.
* Portainer management app for easy Docker administration.
* Locally hosted DNS, LDAP and git repositories.
* Ansible playbooks and docker-compose stacks for automating installation.
* Headless server operation.

The CloudPi project is in a state of flux at the moment. With the release of Raspberry Pi OS 11 (Bullseye) everything is getting reworked. The new version is here:

[https://davescodemusings.github.io/CloudPi/](https://davescodemusings.github.io/CloudPi/)

There may be some rough edges, but it's mostly complete and alpha tested.

If you don't have the latest and greatest OS, [the wiki](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/CloudPi/wiki) still has the previous version using Pi OS 10 (Buster).
